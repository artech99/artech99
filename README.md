Hi, I'm Myesha. I created this repository to store code I've worked on and to showcase skills I've learned.
The files contain code and notes compiled from SQL, Python, and JavaScript courses, as well as on the job experience.
As I continue to learn new advanced skills and work on new projects, I plan to add to this repository.

If you like my work and are interested in my background, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn:
