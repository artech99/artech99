Welcome to My Repository

Hi, I’m Myesha. I’m an IT professional with extensive experience in successfully leading cross-functional teams of engineers and developers. I provide technical direction for program infrastructure upgrades aimed at maintaining system integrity and availability, and I plan balanced approaches to migrate to the cloud.


About Me

My primary role has been as a Product Owner, but I am looking to transition into a more hands-on technical role. My target roles include:
* Data Engineer
* Data Warehouse Developer
* Database Developer
* SQL Developer


Goals and Qualifications

I am dedicated to elevating my skills and staying current with the latest technologies. This repository serves as a portfolio to store code I’ve worked on while also showcasing skills I’ve developed in SQL, Python, and JavaScript, and demonstrating my capabilities for my target roles.

  
Repository Contents

As I continue to learn new advanced skills and work on new projects, I plan to add to this repository. Here, you’ll find:
* SQL scripts and queries
* Python projects and scripts
* JavaScript code snippets and projects
